# Assay ships one image containing four binaries: the operator manager, the
# in-pod scan runner, the console API server, and the standalone CLI. Scan Jobs mount the same image
# for their fetch and publish steps, so there is a single artifact to mirror
# into an air-gapped registry, and `docker run --entrypoint /assay` gives the
# same scanner to anyone without a cluster.
# Must be at least the go directive in go.mod, which oras-go pins to 1.25.
# Pinned to the BUILD platform, not the target. The binaries are pure Go with
# CGO disabled, so GOARCH cross-compiles them natively — emulating this stage
# under QEMU to produce an arm64 binary compiles perhaps twenty times slower
# for an identical result. Only the tiny runtime stage below is arch-specific.
