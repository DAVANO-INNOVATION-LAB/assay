// Package resolver is a thin adapter over tessera-fetch.
//
// Staging an artifact moved into its own module because it never depended on
// Kubernetes and because its dependency tree — an S3 client, an OCI registry
// client — has no business in a library whose value is having none. What stays
// here is the name the controllers already import.
