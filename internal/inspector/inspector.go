// Package inspector is a thin adapter over tessera's artifact walk.
//
// The analysis used to live here. It moved into the library because it is
// artifact analysis rather than orchestration: nothing in it needed an API
// server, and keeping it here meant the same pickle opcode table existed in two
// repositories, free to disagree. What remains is the boundary — the walk's
// findings converted into the custom-resource shape the operator's controllers,
// policies and reports are written against.
