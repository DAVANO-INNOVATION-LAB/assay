// Package evidence produces a portable, verifiable record of why a model was
// allowed or refused.
//
// The problem it addresses is procedural rather than technical. Authorizing an
// AI system today takes months, and much of that is an authorizing official
// re-establishing facts somebody already established. A scan result that lives
// only in a cluster cannot be handed to them; a PDF of a dashboard is not
// evidence, because nothing about it can be checked.
//
// A bundle is the middle thing: a single file holding the verdicts, the
// findings behind them, who accepted which risks, the control mappings, and
// the audit chain — with enough digests inside it that a reader who trusts none
// of it can verify the parts that matter. It is deliberately offline. An
// evidence package that has to phone home is useless in the environments that
// need it most.
