// Package authz decides who may see which models, and how much of a finding
// they are shown.
//
// Scan findings are not neutral facts. A row saying that a named, deployed
// model contains a pickle that calls os.system, at a known path, alongside a
// leaked credential, is a targeting package: it tells an attacker exactly what
// is exploitable and where. So the console cannot simply render whatever the
// cluster holds, and Kubernetes RBAC alone cannot express the rule that is
// needed — RBAC authorizes resource *types*, so anyone able to read a
// namespace reads every finding in it at full detail.
//
// Two independent controls apply, in this order:
//
//   - Scope decides which models a subject may see at all. This is tenancy,
//     and it is deny-by-default: a subject with no matching scope sees nothing,
//     not an empty list of someone else's models.
//   - Role decides how much of each finding they are shown. A model's owner
//     needs the exploit path in order to fix it; an auditor needs the verdict
//     and never needs the path.
//
// Both are enforced here rather than in the UI, because a control implemented
// in a browser is not a control.
