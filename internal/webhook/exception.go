// ExceptionSigner stamps an ArtifactException with the authenticated identity
// of whoever created it.
//
// A waiver is the one place in Assay where a human overrides the machine, so
// it is the one record that has to survive an argument a year later: who
// accepted this risk, when, on what grounds, and against which bytes. A
// free-text "approvedBy" field cannot answer that — anyone who can create the
// object can type anyone's name into it.
//
// The API server has already authenticated the request, so the webhook takes
// the identity from there and overwrites whatever was submitted. That makes
// the attribution a property of the request rather than a claim in its body.
