// Recording admission decisions into the tamper-evident chain.
//
// audit.DeploymentDecision and the DeploymentBlocked and DeploymentAdmitted
// event types existed from the beginning and nothing called them. The chain
// therefore held scans, verdicts and accepted risks — everything except the
// moment a model reached or failed to reach production, which is the event an
// authorizing official asks about first.
//
// Two decisions shape what gets written.
//
// Not every admission is recorded. A Deployment scaling to fifty replicas is
// fifty admission requests, and appending fifty records with a hash chain that
// serialises on a sequence number would turn a routine scale-up into API
// contention inside a webhook. An ordinary approval is also already implied by
// the VerdictIssued record it rests on. What is recorded is every denial, and
// every admission that happened *despite* something — an unscanned model, a
// skip annotation, audit or warn mode, an unidentifiable model. Those are the
// admissions nobody can reconstruct later, and they are rare.
//
// A failed write never changes the decision. The gate's job is to gate; losing
// the paper trail must not turn a denial into an admission or an admission into
// an error the failurePolicy then interprets. Failures are counted so a chain
// that has stopped recording is visible rather than assumed intact.
