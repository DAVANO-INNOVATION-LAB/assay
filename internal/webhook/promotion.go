// PromotionSigner stamps a promotion request with the authenticated identity
// that made it and the authenticated identity that decided it.
//
// This is the same rule ExceptionSigner enforces, for the same reason: whoever
// submits the object controls every field in it, so a requestor or a reviewer
// name in the payload is a claim about who acted, not a record of it. The
// admission request is the only place the real identity exists — by the time a
// controller reads the object, the signature is a field and no longer a fact.
//
// It also refuses the two shapes that would make the record useless later: a
// decision nobody explained, and a decision reassigned to somebody else after
// the fact.
