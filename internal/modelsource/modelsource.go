// Package modelsource abstracts the systems that hold model versions and can
// carry a security verdict — the OpenShift AI Model Registry, MLflow, and
// whatever comes next — behind one interface.
//
// A Source is deliberately not a storage backend. internal/resolver already
// abstracts where the *bytes* live (S3, OCI, PVC); a Source abstracts where a
// model is *declared and tracked*. The two compose: a Source enumerates model
// versions and hands each one's artifact URI to Resolve, which stages the
// bytes so the same inspector and policy engine run regardless of origin.
//
// The three operations are the whole contract:
//
//	List       discover the model versions a source currently holds
//	Resolve    stage one version's bytes onto local disk for scanning
//	WriteBack  record the verdict on the version, in the source's own metadata
//
// Registry scanning and MLflow scanning are then the same pipeline with a
// different Source — one spine, many triggers.
